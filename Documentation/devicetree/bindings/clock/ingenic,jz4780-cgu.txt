Ingenic jz4780 SoC CGU binding

The CGU in a jz4780 SoC provides all the clocks generated on-chip. It includes
PLLs, multiplexers, dividers & gates in order to provide a variety of different
clock signals derived from only 2 external source clocks.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "ingenic,jz4780-cgu"
- reg: Should be the address & length of the CGU registers
- clocks: Should contain the phandle & clock specifier for two clocks external
          to the TCU. First the external crystal "extal" and second the RTC
          clock source "rtclk".
- clock-names: Should be set to strings naming the clocks specified in the
               "clocks" property.
- #clock-cells: Should be 1.
                Clock consumers specify this argument to identify a clock. The
                valid values may be found in <dt-bindings/clock/jz4780-cgu.h>.

Example SoC include file:

/ {
	cgu: jz4780-cgu {
		compatible = "ingenic,jz4780-cgu";
		reg = <0x10000000 0xe0>;
		#clock-cells = <1>;
	};

	uart0: serial@10030000 {
		clocks = <&cgu JZ4780_CLK_UART0>;
	};
};

Example board file:

/ {
	clocks {
		compatible = "simple-bus";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		extal: clock@0 {
			compatible = "fixed-clock";
			#clock-cells = <0>;
			clock-frequency = <48000000>;
		};

		rtclk: clock@1 {
			compatible = "fixed-clock";
			#clock-cells = <0>;
			clock-frequency = <32768>;
		};
	};

	&cgu {
		clocks = <&extal> <&rtclk>;
		clock-names: "extal", "rtclk";
	};
};
